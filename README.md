I try to develop a kernel for fun and as hobby, and I will try only use what I learned on my own from docs
--Steps to Consider:
- ~~Strings funcs~~
- ~~Error prints and Panic~~
- Interrupts
- ~~Frame Management~~
- ~~Heap Management~~ 
- debug and error printing(formatted)
- ~~flat folder structure to modular~~
- EXT2 filesystem 
- VFS
